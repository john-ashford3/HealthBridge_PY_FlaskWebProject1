here are the user stories:
1. As a medical professional, I want to securely store and share patient medical records and images with other healthcare providers, so that we can collaborate on patient care and make informed treatment decisions. With the HealthBridge MedVaultConnect application, I can upload medical images and records to a secure, cloud-based platform that leverages Microsoft Azure services for efficient and scalable storage. I can grant access to other healthcare providers with different access levels depending on their roles, and I can categorize medical data to make it easier to find and share. The application also provides a notification system to alert me when new data is uploaded or access is granted or revoked. With MedVaultConnect, I can streamline medical data sharing and collaboration, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of care.

2. As a patient, I want to have access to my medical records and images, and be able to share them securely with healthcare providers, so that I can receive personalized and efficient healthcare. With the HealthBridge MedVaultConnect application, I can securely log in using my Google, Facebook, or Apple account, or a custom name and password. I can access my medical images and records stored in a secure and HIPAA-compliant manner using Azure Blob Storage. I can grant access to my healthcare providers, and categorize my medical data to make it easier to find and share. The application also allows me to revoke access at any time, giving me full control over who can access my medical data. With MedVaultConnect, I can take an active role in managing my healthcare and ensuring that I receive the best possible care.

Here are the requirements
1. Secure user authentication: Users should be able to securely log in to the application using their Google, Facebook, or Apple accounts, or with a custom username and password.

2. Secure data storage: The application should store medical images and records in a secure, HIPAA-compliant manner using Azure Blob Storage.

3. Access control: 2 factor auth. The owner of the data should be able to grant access to other physicians or healthcare providers, with different access levels depending on their roles.

4. Data categorization: The application should automatically categorize medical data based on type, date, and other factors to make it easier to find and share.

5. Data sharing: The application should allow users to share medical data securely with other healthcare providers, with the ability to revoke access at any time.

6. Notification system: The application should provide an email or notification system to alert users when new data is uploaded, or when access is granted or revoked.

7. Search functionality: The application should allow users to search for specific medical data using keywords and other search parameters.

These are just a few potential features that could be included in the application.
